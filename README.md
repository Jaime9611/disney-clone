## My process

In building this project, I used Webpack to bundle all my files and to compress the images, so that the final "dist" folder will be ready for production. I also configure Webpack to compile the .scss files used for styling the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Webpack

### What I learned

Simple styling with Sass, using mixins and functions to best follow the "DRY" principle, Flexbox for layout and the use of Webpack for bundling and compilation.

### Continued development

Continue learning Sass and learn more about Webpack configuration.

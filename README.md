## Overview

In this project I make use of React, as well as Styled Components library for making all the UI styles. I also put in practice the use of Redux Toolkit for managing the state of the app. In this web app you can search and view the movies that currently are inside a Firebase database, as well as Log in with your Google account or enter as a Demo user.

## My process

In building this project, I used the create-react-app utility, then I make a install and configuration of Redux Toolkit for managing the state and I created a firebase database to keep all the assets and data. I took the styles and assets from the disney-clone tutorial at [Clever Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn8HPNwPEkw) Youtube channel.

### Built with

- React.
- Redux Toolkit.
- React Slick.
- Styled Components.
- Firebase.

### What I learned

My main purpose with this project was to practice the React library, make use of components, routes (react-router), hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) and Redux to create global states. Also learned about Styled Components and how it help to write CSS within Javascript, to make the styles more dinamic.
